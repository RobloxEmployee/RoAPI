      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
      <p>Last Updated: April 26, 2025</p>
      <p>Welcome to <strong>RoAPI</strong> ("we", "our", "us"). RoAPI is a Discord bot developed and maintained by <strong>RobloxEmployee</strong>. It tracks Roblox games and provides real‑time updates on player counts, likes, thumbnails, and more directly within your server. The core service is free to use; optional <em>premium</em> features and additional tracker slots can be purchased via Roblox game passes.</p>
      <h3>1. Use of Service</h3>
      <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use RoAPI. By using the Service, you agree not to engage in illegal or unauthorized activities. You are responsible for safeguarding any account credentials and all actions performed under your account.</p>
      <h3>2. Purchase of Additional Trackers</h3>
      <p>While every user gets a base number of trackers for free, you may acquire more slots through our game passes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/1173067511/1-Tracker" target="_blank">+1 Tracker</a> — 99 R$</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/1175199051/2-Trackers" target="_blank">+2 Trackers</a> — 195 R$</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/1175905801/3-Trackers" target="_blank">+3 Trackers</a> — 285 R$</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3. RoAPI Premium</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sub-Place Notifier:</strong> Get alerts when a game adds new sub-places.</li>
        <li><strong>Detailed Reports:</strong> Weekly, monthly, and yearly summaries showing update counts, visits, likes, favorites, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Priority Cycle:</strong> Premium users receive update notifications much faster than free users.</li>
        <li><strong>Bonus Trackers:</strong> Premium gives you 2 additional tracker slots (total of 4).</li>
        <li>More exclusive features are coming soon!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can get RoAPI Premium by either:</p>
